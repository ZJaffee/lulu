It might be a good idea to autorun it in crontab or something
Right now its running inside of a tmux session (type tmr to connect to it)

Deploy Process
	`sudo su ircbots`
	`cd ~/lulu/`
	`git pull`
	`tmux attach-session` or `tmr`
	> Ctrl-C (kill current hubot instance)
	`~/lulu.sh`
	> Ctrl-B D (detach from tmux instance)

The startup script lives in /home/ircbots/ because it contains the environment variables for token+username/password service auth.

If the tmux session is killed by excessive Ctrl-C, then restart it with `tmux` before running the startup script and detaching from tmux.
